### We are planning to make an advanced version of Jira. The project will have the primary features of Jira such as creating, tracking, and backlogging the issues, bugs, and epics along with component assignment. We also plan to add the below mentioned features:

  

### 1. An Interactive Task Manager

It is impossible for a developer to log in to Jira and update multiple tasks every time. Jira will share the pop up with task summary to every developer and allow them to update their tasks along with comments.

  

### 2. Workload per Developer

Every person has a personal life and takes leaves. Thus, the productivity decreases. This feature will help in determining the productivity and workload of a developer.

  

### 3. Recommendation for Tasks

As the project advances and the workload grows exponentially, it is hard to manually track the developer best fit to take up the new features. This feature will help in recommending the person with appropriate skill set to complete the task within the estimated timeframe.
